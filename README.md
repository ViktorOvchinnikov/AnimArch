# AI-Assisted software modeling

Large language models understand formal languages, including programming languages, in addition to natural language. The capabilities of these models allow them to modify, generate, or, conversely, interpret source code in many languages. Commercial solutions for assistant
programming based on large-scale language models or artificial intelligence models are widely available today. Just as programming languages are used in the implementation phase, software models or diagrams are used in the design phase. Such diagrams can be written using declarative languages such as PlantUML. The present study analyzes the potential applications of large language models in the field of software modeling. The implementation of a prototype for software modeling is achieved through the utilization of a large-scale language model.
We initiated the development of a copilot system with the objective of enhancing the functionality of the existing AnimArch project. The primary objective of this system is to provide assistance to the user in the domain of software modeling.
